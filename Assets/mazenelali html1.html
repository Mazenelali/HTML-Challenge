    <br>


    <p>The city's history stretches back to the 7th century BC as a port city. It saw rapid development during the following periods as a Persian and subsequently Hellenic, Roman, Byzantine and eventually Arab city. The latter which would bring it to the forefront of trade, commerce and education throughout the Middle East. Tripoli is therefore considered Lebanon's most ancient city with surviving souks and mosques that were built up to 9 and 10 centuries ago.</p>
    <p>In recent times the city has witnessed an unfortunate financial decline due to the shift of wealth southwards towards Beirut. This began towards the start of the 19th century as Beirut moved from Ottoman to the colonial French era. This brought about extensive investment and development to the capital as Tripoli which was formerly a capital of its own state, was negated to becoming the second city in the newly created "<i>Greater Lebanon</i></i>".</p>
    <p>Tripoli's historic status, coupled with a young and dynamic well educated populace has meant that the city continues to be a contender for strong growth and development in Lebanon (given the right investment). The city's unfinished and highly cherished International Fair, built by Oscar Niemeyer during Lebanon's big state days of<i> Fouad Chihab</i>, is testament to a story of what could have been</p>
